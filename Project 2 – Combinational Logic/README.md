# Project 2 - Combinational Logic

## Objective

The purpose of this design assignment was to create different types of modules with the use of combinational logic in Verilog. While completing this task, the group continued exploring in the Xilinx platform and Verilog. Through this assignment the team: prepared truth tables, wrote Verilog code per module, and made test fixtures to test each module. This assignment tasked the group to create: a full adder, a 4-bit adder, a 3-bit comparator, a 4-16 decoder, a priority encoder, and a 4-1 multiplexer.
