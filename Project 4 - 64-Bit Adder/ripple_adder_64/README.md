# Ripple Carry Adder (64-bit)

## Objective

This 64-bit adder was designed using a structural gate-level implementation of many full adders linked together into a ripple-carry adder design.

This module tested: all possible combinations from 0 to 31 and, separately, two large 32-bit integers.

## Waveforms

Test 1: Simulation results from the Verilog representation of this Ripple Carry Adder **(All possible combinations from 0 to 31)**

Test 2: Simulation results from the Verilog representation of this Ripple Carry Adder **(Two large 32-bit integers)**
